# DeathTracker-SoulsGames
A simple death tracker for souls games. It has shortcuts so you can easily count deaths, and separate the counter per different areas or bosses.

## How to execute?
Download the [DeathCounter.exe](https://github.com/JoseVincoski/DeathTracker-SoulsGames/blob/main/ReleasedApp/DeathCounter.exe) and execute it. (preferably in a folder, because files will be created to log your deaths)

## How it works?
Type the area or boss you are in to keep a separated track of your total deaths and the deaths in the specific area you are on.

- Press Page Up to increase your death counter.
- Press Page Down to decrease your death counter.

- If you need to change your area or boss name, press home to force focus into the app window.

## Future work
- I still want to create a page with graphs and more info on your deaths per area/boss.
- I'll soon add configuration to the shortcuts.
