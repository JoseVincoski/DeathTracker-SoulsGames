# DeathTracker-SoulsGames
A simple death tracker for souls games. It has shortcuts so you can easily count more deaths, and separate the counter per different areas or bosses.

You can use Page Up to add deaths, and Page Down to remove if you added by accident.

If you change the Area Name your counter will be divided into the total death counter, and the area (or boss fight) counter.

Press home to force focus on the app form.
